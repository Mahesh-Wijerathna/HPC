/*****************************************************************************
* FILE: join.c
* DESCRIPTION:
*   This example demonstrates how to "wait" for thread completions by using
*   the Pthread join routine.  Threads are explicitly created in a joinable
*   state for portability reasons. Use of the pthread_exit status argument is 
*   also shown. Compare to detached.c
